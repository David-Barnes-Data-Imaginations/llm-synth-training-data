The transformer architecture, introduced in the paper \\\"Attention Is All You Need\\\", is built upon a sequence of layers that perform self\u2011attention and feed\u2011forward transformations. Each token in the input sequence is projected into an embedding space, and positional encodings are added to retain order information. The self\u2011attention mechanism computes pairwise attention scores between tokens, allowing each token to gather context from the entire sequence in parallel. The resulting weighted sum is passed through a multi\u2011head attention module, split into several representation sub\u2011spaces, which are then concatenated and linearly transformed. Subsequent to attention, a position\u2011wise feed\u2011forward network is applied, followed by layer normalisation and residual connections. This stack repeats N times, yielding highly contextualised representations that can be exploited for tasks such as translation, summarisation, or question\u2011answering."}]
